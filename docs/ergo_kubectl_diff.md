## ergo kubectl diff

Diff the live version against a would-be applied version

### Synopsis

Diff configurations specified by file name or stdin between the current online configuration, and the configuration as it would be if applied.

 The output is always YAML.

 KUBECTL_EXTERNAL_DIFF environment variable can be used to select your own diff command. Users can use external commands with params too, example: KUBECTL_EXTERNAL_DIFF="colordiff -N -u"

 By default, the "diff" command available in your path will be run with the "-u" (unified diff) and "-N" (treat absent files as empty) options.

 Exit status: 0 No differences were found. 1 Differences were found. >1 Kubectl or diff failed with an error.

 Note: KUBECTL_EXTERNAL_DIFF, if used, is expected to follow that convention.

```
ergo kubectl diff -f FILENAME
```

### Examples

```
  # Diff resources included in pod.json
  kubectl diff -f pod.json
  
  # Diff file read from stdin
  cat service.yaml | kubectl diff -f -
```

### Options

```
      --field-manager string   Name of the manager used to track field ownership. (default "kubectl-client-side-apply")
  -f, --filename strings       Filename, directory, or URL to files contains the configuration to diff
      --force-conflicts        If true, server-side apply will force the changes against conflicts.
  -h, --help                   help for diff
  -k, --kustomize string       Process the kustomization directory. This flag can't be used together with -f or -R.
  -R, --recursive              Process the directory used in -f, --filename recursively. Useful when you want to manage related manifests organized within the same directory.
  -l, --selector string        Selector (label query) to filter on, supports '=', '==', and '!='.(e.g. -l key1=value1,key2=value2)
      --server-side            If true, apply runs in the server instead of the client.
